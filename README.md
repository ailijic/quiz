# quiz

It's up to you to come up with the topic you want to quiz users on and how the app will look and feel. The minimum requirements are as follows.

Create an interactive quiz that:

Requires the user to answer at least five questions
Shows each question one at a time
Tells the user each question's number and how many questions remain
Prevents the user from skipping questions
Gives the user some way to answer each question
Compares the user's answer, and the correct answer to determine a score
Displays the user's final score once all questions have been answered
Allows the user to start a new game once all questions have been answered
Uses objects to represent the questions and answers
Hint: You may want to store the question objects in an array

If you are feeling particularly ambitious, consider implementing the following features:

Shows the user their current score as they move through the quiz
Shows the user if their response is correct or not when they answer each question
Display the correct answer if the user guessed incorrectly
Display some information related to the correct answer
Instead of a standard multiple choice quiz, build a personality quiz
Steps
1) Spend some time thinking about the topic you want to quiz users about. Pick a topic that you find interesting or something you know more about than the average person.

2) Next spend some time considering how to best achieve the functional requirements outlined above. Think about how you can make it easy and intuitive for users to begin a new game, answer questions, and find out how they scored?

3) After you know in general terms what you want to create, it's time to sketch your app. You're free to use pen and paper, a graphics program like Illustrator, Photoshop or Sketch, or a mockup tool like Balsamiq to create your designs.

4) Try to spend about 1 to 2 hours total on this assignment. When you've completed your designs, submit your mockup assets to your mentor by submitting a link to a Google Drive folder containing the files and talk through your design process in your next session.
